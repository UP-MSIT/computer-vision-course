## Introduction to DNNs 

**What is DNNs?**
- Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) are a class of
artificial neural
networks with multiple
layers between the input
and output layers


**Example: Building a Simple Neural Network**

- **Basic components**
  - **Neurons**: The basic units of a neural network,
inspired by biological neurons
  - **Weights**: Parameters that determine the influence of
each input on the neuron's output
  - **Biases**: Additional parameters that adjust the output
along with the weighted sum of the inputs.
  - **Activation Function**: A Function apply to the neurons
- **Layers in Neural Networks**
  - Input layer
  - Hidden Layer
  - Output layer
- **Key Processes**
  - **Feedforward**: The process where input data passes through the network layers
to generate an output.

  - **Backpropagation**: The training process that involves adjusting the weights and
  biases to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output

## 3.1 Recurrent Neural Network
### **Introduction**
**- What is RNNs?**
  - Design for processing sequential data.  
    - Sequential Proccessing: process data one step at a time
    - Parameter Sharing: The same weights are used all the steps.
- Difference Between RNNs and Tradition NNs
